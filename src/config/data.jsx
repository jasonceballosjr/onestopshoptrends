      "As seen on TikTok! This wonderful shower accessory makes it easy to get those hard to reach areas on your back. Not only that, It can placed on the ground to scrub the bottom of your feet! We all know how annoying and inconvenient that is. One of my favorite attributes about this product is that it retains that frothy soap feeling. It might be due to varying length of the scrubbies on the pad, but either way, I really enjoy super foamy soap! Thanks to the myriad of small suctions cups on the back, it can be placed anywhere and will always hit that spot you've been itching to scratch! Disclosure: Links contain affiliates.

      "Running out of storage on your phone? Worry no more! HP Sprocket provides an instant photo printer that connects to your iOS/Android device. One of the most interesting features, in my opinion, is that it uses ZERO INK! With Over 11k views and rated at 4.5/5, this item is clearly a must have. To me, I find it to be an absolute pain getting pictures from my phone printed out. Pictures from any device really! You have to go to Walgreens or whatever local store is capable of printing pictures. Overtime, the cost of printing your pictures will become more than this device here!

      "Compressed Sponges! These sponges expand when they are wet, and are designed to give your skin a deep clean with its exfoliating textures. Most sponges take up so much space, but not these! When you click the link above, you'll find that there are two options. You can choose from a 40 count and a 52 count. In my opinion, the price for these is exponentially less than if you were to constantly buy name brand. It's all the same material! I enjoy this product because it reminds me of those little capsules I had as a kid. I would take a bath and then the capsule would dissolve and expand in the water into a WHOLE TOWEL! I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say, I love hydration. Check out this product and many more in the link above! Disclosure: Links contain affiliates.
