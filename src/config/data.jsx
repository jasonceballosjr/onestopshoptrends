    description:
      "As seen on TikTok! This wonderful shower accessory makes it easy to get those hard to reach areas on your back. Not only that, It can placed on the ground to scrub the bottom of your feet! We all know how annoying and inconvenient that is. One of my favorite attributes about this product is that it retains that frothy soap feeling. It might be due to varying length of the scrubbies on the pad, but either way, I really enjoy super foamy soap! Thanks to the myriad of small suctions cups on the back, it can be placed anywhere and will always hit that spot you've been itching to scratch! Disclosure: Links contain affiliates.
